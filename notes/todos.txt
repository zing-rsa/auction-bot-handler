- setup local mongo
- create second bot app
- store creds in db and try run both at same time.

Test cases 















DONE: Handle case where bot is restarting during a start/end event
DONE: Fix crash on failed DM
    FIXED - fixed crash, but now guildCreate doesn't fire on second bot add
DONE: Payment address to be included
DONE: https link to NFT
DONE: Description field
DONE - /bid
DONE - /price
DONE - bid extend function
DONE - embeds 
DONE - image-url
DONE - remove ping
DONE - deploy and test on server
DONE - Setup walkthrough process
DONE   - keep in mind that deploy-commands needs to be run

- Handle missing permissions elegantly?
 - if bot can't access the channels it needs to, what happens ? 
    - does entire server crash? ie. require restart ?
    - does it just fail and carry on ?

- defer replies on all commands? 

- listen for old !bid and !create

- don't send fucked dates

- email noties when it goes down?
 - or when auction ends

- dont' ship with hardcoded times

Testing:

NONISSUE - case where user dismisses defered reply before response
NONISSUE   - bot abandons reply


- randomly crashed during create, on logger step? create.js:71
 - weird

- if one thing is awaiting, when another occurs in the background, 
- it means that the vars like client/interaction get overwritten, 
- once the await resolves, the vars are now different
- start setup in one channel, breakpoint after awaitMessage
- start auction in another channel, continue setup, check breakpoint vars
-- NOT THE CASE

- does a user setting up a bot block other auctions? 
 - NOPE

- test how long you can wait before sending the channel ID's
 - ITS LONG
