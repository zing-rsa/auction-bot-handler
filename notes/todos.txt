- check how normal commands work
- setup local mongo
- create second bot app
- store creds in db and try run both at same time.

TODO: 

- Handle missing permissions elegantly?
 - if bot can't access the channels it needs to, what happens ? 
    - does entire server crash? ie. require restart ?
    - does it just fail and carry on ?

- defer replies on all commands? 

- listen for old !bid and !create

- don't send fucked dates

- email noties when it goes down?
 - or when auction ends

- dont' ship with hardcoded times

DONE - /bid

DONE - /price

DONE - bid extend function

DONE - embeds 

DONE - image-url

DONE - remove ping

DONE - deploy and test on server

DONE - Setup walkthrough process
  DONE - keep in mind that deploy-commands needs to be run


Testing:

What if bot is restarting during a start/end event

- randomly crashed during create, on logger step? create.js:71
 - weird

suspiscion:

- if one thing is awaiting, when another occurs in the background, 
- it means that the vars like client/interaction get overwritten, 
- once the await resolves, the vars are now different
- start setup in one channel, breakpoint after awaitMessage
- start auction in another channel, continue setup, check breakpoint vars

-- NOT THE CASE

- does a user setting up a bot block other auctions? 
 - NOPE

- test how long you can wait before sending the channel ID's
 - ITS LONG


- test multiple auctions concurrently in one server
