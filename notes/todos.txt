  - auction should open and close at correct time

- create auction and restart bot
  - auction should open and close at correct time

- delete channel of auction before start
    - should cancel auction silently

- delete channel of auction before end
    - should cancel auction silently

- delete auction channel after completing

- test multiple auctions concurrently in one server
