Create bot on portal

Save details(guild, channel, auction cat, token) to mongo bots db
 - if automated should:
    - require token, guild, _id props
    - fetch bot from db based on client._id
    - check correct guild

    - if auction_cat doesn't exist, ask for auction_cat
    - if comm_channel doesn't exist, ask for comm_channel
    - if tx_channel doesn't exist, ask for tx_channel

    - if all 3 of the above are good to go, register commands for guild

Generate disc link with perms in v1_perms.png
 - v1 - (<url>&permissions=268528656&scope=applications.commands%20bot)

Send link to person

Once they invite, run node deploy-commands.js(registers the bot for use in that server)

Make sure bot can access all necessary channels.

Should be good to go.
