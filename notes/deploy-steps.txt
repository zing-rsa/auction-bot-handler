Create bot on portal

Save details(guild, channel, auction cat, token) to mongo bots db

Generate disc link with perms in v1_perms.png
 - v1 - (<url>&permissions=268528656&scope=applications.commands%20bot)

Send link to person

Once they invite, run node deploy-commands.js(registers the bot for use in that server)

Make sure bot can access all necessary channels.

Should be good to go.
