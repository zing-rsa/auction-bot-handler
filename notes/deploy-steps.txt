Create bot on portal

Existing

- create DB objects, with token, guild, all channels SETUP_COMPLETE=true

- kill the old py worker

- start the new node worker
  - the two servers with existing bots should just start seemlessly

- ask them to re add the bot - this is just to accept new perms and register commands

- ask them to give the bot access to the channels and categories it needs again

New -

- create db object with id, guild, token
- restart node worker
- ask him to add bot with link
  - this should force setup
