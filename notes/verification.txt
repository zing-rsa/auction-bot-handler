user hits /register

bot generates user object in DB
- creates and stores nonce against user
 - userid
   - nonce

bot gathers userid, user avatar, user name
bot generates JWT with userid encoded within payload

bot generates url for frontend, query params for each of above

user signs data
 - gets sig, key

frontend posts 
 - sig
 - key
 - reward addr
 - token(header)

backend middleware validates jwt against pk(shared with bot)
stores req.userid

pulls user nonce from db, runs sig check
 - passes key, sig, nonce

if sig check passes
- create bech32 addy from reward_addr
- update user(should already exist since bot created it with nonce)
  - userid = userid
    - stake_addr
