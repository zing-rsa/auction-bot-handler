DONE:  - token(header)

DONE - backend middleware validates jwt against pk(shared with bot)
DONE - stores req.userid

DONE - pulls user nonce from db, runs sig check
DONE   - passes key, sig, nonce

DONE -if sig check passes
DONE - create bech32 addy from reward_addr
DONE - update user(should already exist since bot created it with nonce)
DONE   - userid = userid
DONE     - stake_addr
